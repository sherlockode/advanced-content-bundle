Tools
=====

The page acb/tools allows you to [import](import.md) / [export](export.md) your entities.

By default, the template used for this page is `@SherlockodeAdvancedContent/Tools/index.html.twig`
You can override this by adding your own file in the configuration :

```yaml
# config/packages/sherlockode_advanced_content.yml
sherlockode_advanced_content:
    templates:
        tools: 'dir/template.html.twig'
```

If you are using our extension for Sonata ([SonataBundle](https://github.com/sherlockode/SonataAdvancedContentBundle/)), 
there is already a customized template for Sonata that will change the default template to `SherlockodeSonataAdvancedContent/Tools/index.html.twig`
To bypass this and use your template, you will also have to add the following configuration:

```yaml
# config/packages/sherlockode_sonata_advanced_content.yml
sherlockode_sonata_advanced_content:
    use_bundle_templates:
        tools: false
```

On this page, you will be able to :
- import your entities : upload any yaml file containing your entity. 
As long as you respect the [format](import.md), you can include as many entities in the file as you want
- export your entities : you will be able to select which entity/entities you want to export. 
This will result in a zip file being downloaded in your browser.

## Security

To access this page, you will need to add the role ROLE_SHERLOCKODE_ADVANCED_CONTENT_TOOLS to your hierarchy

For example, if you want to grant access to this page for ROLE_ADMIN, you can add : 
```yaml
# config/packages/security.yaml
security:
    role_hierarchy:
        ROLE_ADMIN:
            - ROLE_SHERLOCKODE_ADVANCED_CONTENT_TOOLS
```
